[**Comparator networks**][2], also known as **sorting networks**, are fast algorithms for sorting or accumulating a fixed number of inputs. **ComparatorNetworks.jl** is a Julia package for discovering, analyzing, testing, and optimizing comparator networks.

A comparator network consists of horizontal **wires** and an ordered sequence of vertical **comparators**. Each comparator connects two wires and represents an operation, such as [**`minmax`**][3] or [**TwoSum**][4], that takes and returns two values. Comparator networks are called **sorting networks** when used to sort their input data, but they can also be applied to other tasks, such as partial sorting, median selection, and [high-precision arithmetic][5].

Finding [optimal sorting networks][6] is a notoriously hard combinatorial optimization problem. The optimal number of comparators in a sorting network remains unknown as of 2025, even for as few as 13 inputs. **ComparatorNetworks.jl** implements heuristic optimization algorithms based on [simulated annealing][7] to find comparator networks of minimal length (number of comparators) and depth (number of sequential dependencies) for a variety of tasks.
